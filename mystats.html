    <h3>Prawns Fry</h3>
    <p>Prawns fry or India shrimp fry is a simple yet flavorful 
       Indian seafood side dish made with Indian spices and herbs
       Prawns stir fry is not only easy to make but also has a lot 
       of health benefits. They are rich in omega 3 fatty acids, 
       less in calories, and tastes absolutely delicious when made right. 
       And this recipe is one of our family favorites and typically 
       vanishes immediately once it is served on the table
